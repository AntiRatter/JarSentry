# JarSentry
JarRATScanner is a heuristic-based analysis tool designed to help users assess potential risk indicators in Minecraft .jar mods.  It focuses on static inspection, reputation checks, and common Remote Access Trojan (RAT) indicators — it is not an antivirus and does not execute or detonate files.
